It is possible to define some type(s) which cannot be tokenized easily.
Use the command line:
-t FILE

FILE is a file with a new type per line.
The comment sign is # at the beginning of a line.

Example:

      +---------------------+
      | # this is a comment |
      | abc                 |
      | a_new_type_for_now  |
      +---------------------+
